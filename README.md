# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
Pizza project using python and django.

2 apps, one for orders and one for account.
The special pizza is shown first on the website and is a special creation by the chef, which can be modified on the admin panel.

As personal touches I modified the admin panel, so prices can be changed on the list view.
I included stripe payment and a confirmation email sent to the user.
The status of the order can be changed one the ordewr is ready for pickup.

Cheers!
